  <h3>Hildogos past with me</h3> When i first met Hildogo at Kohl's ranch i was 8 and we went
  horse back riding i found a painted horse cause i love painted horses. Hildogo was the best horse
  ever,funny thing is he loves to roll in the dirt. i cant wait to go horse back riding again. Here is
  a picture of a pretty horse that looks like him. i hope hidogo is still there when i go again if hes gone
  i dont know what i would do cause thats how special he is to me, every day i would go bye there and give
  him an apple or carrot.

  <h2>Why i love Hildogo</h2>

  <p>
    I love him so much we had some funny moments together. The last time i went back
    i had no clue witch one he was cause there was alot more painted horses there
    but of course i look over there he was rolling in dirt i called him over he seen me then
    he started running over to me, me and him got so exited. I will post pictures of me and him
    when i get pictures of me and him my dad has the pictures of me and him. Hildogo is the best
    horse i ever met he was the nicest horse i ever meet i meet a gypsy vanner that was a cute horses
    but i got kicked bye him so he wasnt the best horse ive seen ive seen hildogo that was a good
    horse.
