  <h3>Hildogos past with me</h3> When i first met Hildogo at Kohl's ranch i was 8 and we went
  horse back riding i found a painted horse cause i love painted horses. Hildogo was the best horse
  ever,funny thing is he loves to roll in the dirt. i cant wait to go horse back riding again. Here is
  a picture of a pretty horse that looks like him.
