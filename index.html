    Today I will be talking about the best horse hildogo. Hildogo was the horse
    I used to ride he was a really good horse. Im not talking about the movie hildogo at
    Kohl's Ranch there is a horse thats named hildogo. I love horses,they are my first favorite animal.

  <h3>Hildogos past with me</h3>

  <p>
    When I first met Hildogo at Kohl's ranch I was 8 and we went
  horse back riding I found a painted horse cause I love painted horses. Hildogo was the best horse
  ever,funny thing is he loves to roll in the dirt. I cant wait to go horse back riding again.
   I hope hidogo is still there when I go again if hes gone
   I dont know what I would do cause thats how special he is to me,
   every day I would go by there and give him an apple or carrot.
  </p>


  <h2>Why i love Hildogo</h2>

  <p>
    I love him so much we had some funny moments together. The last time I went back
    I had no clue witch one he was cause there was alot more painted horses there
    but of course I look over there he was rolling in dirt I called him over he seen me then
    he started running over to me. Hildogo is the best
    horse I ever met he was the nicest horse I ever met I met a gypsy vanner that was a cute horse
    but he stepped on me so he wasnt the best horse ive seen,ive seen hildogo that was a good
    horse. Im not trying to take that other horse out of the story but I just love hildogo more.
