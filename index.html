  <h3>Hildogos past with me</h3> When i first met Hildogo at Kohl's ranch i was 8 and we went
  horse back riding i found a painted horse cause i love painted horses. Hildogo was the best horse
  ever,funny thing is he loves to roll in the dirt. i cant wait to go horse back riding again.

    I love him so much we had some funny moments together. The last time i went back
    i had no clue witch one he was cause there was alot more painted horses there

     he started running over to me,me and him got so exited.
