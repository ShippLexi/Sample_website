    The whole reson why I like that picture is because it talks about god and horses and I
    love both of them I belive in god and I love horses. Horses are the most beatiful animals in
    the world. This is at least what I think.

    My favorite horse is a painted horses Hildogo was a painted horse, he was the most inportant
    horse ever. Hildogo was the nicest horse i could ever meet, I love him so much hopefully
    I get to see him soon. I wish he was my horse that lived with me but apparently to my mom
    the back yard is to small, my dad says its fine for a horse to go back there so I dont
    know what im going to do with the horse I really want besides Hildogo the horses name is Clyde

    My cousin is so obsessed with unicorns and I love horses and he says unicorns are the best thing in
    world when I think horses are the best thing in the world. He said he still likes horses but he loves
    unicorns more but thats fine cause we all have different opinions.
